# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Nomvember 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Work on my Flexbox skills using Grid and started the design of a new web page with the goal of have a better determinate project, this website will be my very own project to make it my presententation card for the people to judge my work.

**Thoughts:** Today i started my very first day of the challenge the first idea that came to my head was to continue one of my old project but relized that is pointless as i don't feel like it's something that will help me grow (it's already done after all) so i decided to start a new project, my current goal with this website is to get deep into html and css and to learn PHP as well, and of course JavaScript my first love in this world <3.

**Link to work:** i feel a bit ashamed but i don't know yet how to properly show my progress, but soon will leave my project here

### Day 1: December 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finish my very first web page part of freecodecamp web responsive desgin certificacion

**Thoughts**: I really enjoy working on this, the hardest parts has been to adapt myself to this challenge due to my own laziness something i'm working on it took me a few days to actually start because as the challenge dictates i must first finish the curriculum, but feeling bad for not starting i decided to use this to actually do something, i struggle with the locations, margins and paddings on css something i'm looking foward to work with!

### Day 2: December 4, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Work on my FreeCodeCamp projects wirth a form, the basic html structure is ready, the basic CSS is ready as well which contains stylized fonts and inputs (love the lobster font :3) but the order is still lacking i need to work on it.

**Thoughts** Order and divs are still getting onto me as i try to put everything on a single div instead of making a div to every element i wanna work on it with more detail

## Day 3: December 6, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did not have any kind of progress on the form as i only play with the paddings and margins(i ended up deleting everything on it but the main structure and the customize style of them)

**Thoughts** Work on my padding and margin along with the float property it works pretty fine but i still to work in order to master it, my goal keep being the sme, workas a web developer to keep studying
